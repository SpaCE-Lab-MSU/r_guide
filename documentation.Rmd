#Documentation

Documenting your work may be the most important part of this style guide.  
There are many ways to get a script to do it's work, but a script is useless if we don't know what it does, and how to use it.    There are two main types of in-script documentation : documentation suggested and structure for the lab, and documentation done for R packaging using the program Roxygen2.     Roxygen2 is a way to write comments in your code that can automatically be turned into R help documentation.    This guide currently does not mention that, but focuses on basics for docs, but these are not exclusive and eventually the stuff here should be made Roxygen2 formatted.    Rstudio has features to make it easy to write Roxygen2-style comments.  

The following in R code all start with Comments (#) 
    All scripts need a good description in the beginning - what does this script do? What kind of data does it read in and what does it output?

```{r }        
# TITLE: name of the script
# AUTHORS (list anyone contributing to the file)
# COLLABORATORS (other people involved in the wider project but not necessarily on the script)
# DATA INPUT (a brief description of the data read in through the script, including what format it’s in)
# DATA OUTPUT (a brief description of the data output from through the script, including what format it’s in)
# PROJECT (what overarching project this is part of: in this case it’s Frugivoria)
# DATE (initiation date of script, plus any major update dates)
 
```   
    NOTE : this guide was written without consideration for the Roxygen documentation system and if you are working on an R package, you should use that system but incorporate as much of this as possible.   See these great introductions to this system : https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/docs.html  and http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html
    
    Note also that Roxygen2 focus is on creating documentation for using functions, not the provenance of a set of scripts which is crucial for a research project. .
