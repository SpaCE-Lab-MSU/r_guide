# RMarkdown

After you've written source code and maybe a package, an RMarkdown document is a good way to demonstrate how to use your code and results. R Markdown is an authoring framework for R code and output. R Markdown is part word-processor, part R output. It enables you to generate nice reports with R code, figures, tables, and text. It’s handy because it produces neat summaries of your work in HTML or PDF or other formats (Word docs). 

R Markdown is especially helpful with collaborative research and coursework, and is often used in supplemental materials with publications. If you haven’t already watched the R Markdown tutorial, you may want to refer to it when putting together an analysis write-up: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html (including “How it Works”, “Code Chunks”, and “Markdown Basics”). I recommend using “KnitR” when you want to publish (i.e., click on “knit to HTML”, “knit to PDF”, etc. in the pull-down menu in RStudio).

When you click the Knit button in R Studio (looks like a knitting needle with ball of yarn) a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Examples of RMarkdown: 

All of the tutorials form https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html  are written in RMarkdown.  You can view these tutorials in the github repository for their website, e.g https://github.com/ourcodingclub/ourcodingclub.github.io/tree/master/_tutorials  If you open any one of these .md files in github and click 'raw' you see the markdown code. 

Note that Rstudio is not required to use RMarkdown but it's the entry point for most.   Rstudio has extended Rmarkdown to make it interactive for reporting (e.g. with Shiny, another topic entirely)

## R Notebooks

This is an Rstudio feature that builds up on RMarkdown and is a way to interactively create an RMarkdown file much like the Rconsole.  It's patterned after Jupyter Notebooks used for Python.   It's not required to write RMarkdown.
